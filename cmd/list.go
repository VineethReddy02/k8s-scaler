and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,

# You can provide path to the KUBECONFIG using --kubeconfig flag
# If not provided k8s-scaler reads the KUBECONFIG environment variable
# If KUBECONFIG env is not set tries find InClusterConfig using k8s client-go

# To list namespaces, deployments, pods, daemonsets
